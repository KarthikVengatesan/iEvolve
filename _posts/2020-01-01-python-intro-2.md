- Go to download section of open-source anaconda distribution for window and download the anaconda installer.
                  
- When the download is completed, double-click the file and follow the instructions to install anaconda in your system.
                  
When Anaconda is installed, an application called Anaconda Navigator is installed in your PC which you can get from window start menu.
                  
- It’s a single tool to launch python development environment to run our python scripts. This includes Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Qt Console and so on.

- One cool thing about Python is that there are several ways to run code with Python. You can run it as a script, like you would with a normal programming language. You can also write it using Jupyter Notebook, which is what we will be using here. Where you actually have a web browser-like view in which you can actually write little notations and notes to yourself in HTML markup stuff, and you can also embed actual code that really runs using the Python interpreter. It is most preferred by data scientist and good for beginner to start with. Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.

​Once done let’s start executing some simple python scripts in Jupyter notebook as follows,
                


    num1 = 2
    num2 = 3
    sum = num1 + num2
    print(sum)
    5
